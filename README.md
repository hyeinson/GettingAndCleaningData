# GettingAndCleaningData

The dataset includes following:
- 'README.md'
- 'run_analysis.R'
- 'CookBook.md'
- 'GettingAndCleaningDataProject.txt'

The 'run_analysis.R' file contains all the codes that were run to achieve a final, tidy data frame named 'GettingAndCleaningDataProject.txt'

The 'CookBook.md' file describes the details of variables and transformations that appear in the 'run_analysis.R' file.

The 'HumanActivityRecog.zip' file was downloaded to '~/data/HumanActivityRecog.zip' on my local computer and then was unzipped to create a folder named 'UCI HAR Dataset' in my directory of '~/data'.

The 'run_analysis.R' file was run in the directory '~/data/UCI HAR Dataset'.
